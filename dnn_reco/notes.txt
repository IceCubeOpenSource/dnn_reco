Steps to do to include biased selection
---------------------------------------

- refactor ic3-modules model creation in independent tf.Session and graph: move out code to misc or utils for reusability

- create independent session and graph in file_loader() function
--> Check: does __enter__() [e.g. change of default session] mess with the training procedure?
--> If it does, does it help to also have training process in independent session and graph?

- every n steps/batches/files: reload weights

- predict for batch events: calculate diff in normalized coordinates and define parameters how to mask/sample events based on this [also include option to define abs/unc units]

- also take events from files without biased selection: account for these in function counter and take less from other file


- clean up version A and B
- clean up debug prints

- add settings to config and remove it from code

Additional ToDos
----------------

- Fix architecture settings for proper number of layers
- Use proper 1D convolution with strings in channel dimension [or FC layers for upper DeepCore?]
- shift mis-aligned DOMs to correct z-axis
- use proper residual layers


- Create regression problem with astroness as label
